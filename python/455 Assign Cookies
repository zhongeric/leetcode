Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed factor gi, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size sj. If sj >= gi, we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

Note:
You may assume the greed factor is always positive.
You cannot assign more than one cookie to one child.

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3], [1,1]

Output: 1

Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.
Example 2:
Input: [1,2], [1,2,3]

Output: 2

Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
You need to output 2.

class Solution:
    def findContentChildren(self, g: List[int], s: List[int]) -> int:
        ctr = 0
        g.sort()
        s.sort()
        
        child_ctr = 0
        
        for cookie in s:
            if(child_ctr >= len(g)):
                # finsihed with children
                return ctr
            if(cookie >= g[child_ctr]):
                ctr += 1
                # only increment if cookie >= child
                # bc then we have to remove that child (or just move to next
                # child in this situation, by iterating to next one.)
                child_ctr += 1
            
        return ctr
